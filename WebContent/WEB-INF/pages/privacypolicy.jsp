							<p class=condition>We use data collection devices such as
								"cookies" on certain pages of the Website to help analyze our
								web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote
								trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard
								drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain
								features that are only available through the use of a "cookie".</p>
							<p class=condition>Additionally, you may encounter "cookies"

								opt-in.</p>

							<p class=condition>We may disclose personal information if
								required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such

								the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably
								necessary to: enforce our Terms or Privacy Policy; respond to

								the rights of a third party; or protect the rights, property or
								personal safety of our users or the general public.</p>
